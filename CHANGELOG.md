## Unreleased

## 1.4.0

- First public release of the mature prepare-only Snapshot Runner core under Apache-2.0.
- Four stable commands collect local repository status, staged/unstaged changes,
  sealed branch-review evidence, and bounded existing test logs.
- Supports unborn and linked worktrees, exact-path scoped diff audits, initial
  publication evidence, and bounded deterministic JSON summaries.
- Preserves snapshot schema 2, security epoch 4, private atomic artifacts, SHA-256
  verification, and explicit absolute repository boundaries.
- Standard-library-only runtime with isolated wheel/sdist installation.
- Shared quality checks; GitHub-only package builds and approved PyPI Trusted Publishing;
  matching GitHub/Gitea annotated tag identities and resumable Release records.
